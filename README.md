# backbase
BackBase interview task

Tasks Explanation:

1) Shown a modular application by lazy-loading
2) Shown use of routing module in a lazy loaded application
3) Generalized the use of HTTPClient by creating a general service called http-proxy which can take service names and perform a get request
4) Shown a scalable application structure
5) Shown a few examples of unit test cases including testing of mock services in the weather.service.spec.ts
6) The API base url is stored in both environment.ts and environment.prod.ts so the application will run on both environments
7) The API key is also stored in both environment.ts and environment.prod.ts so the application will run on both environments
8) Used Material Components such as expandable-panel and spinner
9) Shown how reusable components such as Material can have their own shared module
10) The UI is not so appealing as I am not a good designer (Apologies for that)
